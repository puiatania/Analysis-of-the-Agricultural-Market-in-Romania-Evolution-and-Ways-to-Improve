üìä Results of the Thesis: Agricultural Market Analysis in Romania

1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

This document presents a structured summary of the key findings from the thesis "Analysis of the Agricultural Market in Romania: Evolution and Improvement Strategies." It covers various statistical and econometric methods used to analyze trends, price indices, and consumer preferences regarding organic products.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Time Series Analysis

The analysis of agricultural price indices in Romania was conducted using Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) to determine the long-term relationship between domestic and European agricultural markets.

Data Used:

Source: EUROSTAT database, covering the period Q1 2010 - Q3 2023.

Variables analyzed:

INCRT_RO ‚Äì Real price index for consumer goods in Romania.

ININV_RO ‚Äì Real price index for agricultural investment goods in Romania.

INCRT_EU ‚Äì Real price index for consumer goods in the EU.

ININV_EU ‚Äì Real price index for agricultural investment goods in the EU.

Key Findings:

Stationarity Tests:

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirmed that price indices were non-stationary at levels but became stationary after first differencing.

The Phillips-Perron (PP) test supported ADF results, confirming that the variables are integrated of order one, allowing for further cointegration analysis.

Johansen Cointegration Test:

Results indicated the existence of two significant cointegration relationships, suggesting that Romanian agricultural price indices move together with the EU indices in the long run.

Impulse Response Functions (IRF):

The model demonstrated that an external shock in EU agricultural prices has a delayed but long-term impact on Romanian markets.

The response of domestic prices is most significant within the first 3-5 periods after a shock, showing a dependency on external price fluctuations.

The effect of the shock gradually diminishes but does not disappear entirely, indicating a long-term connection with EU markets.

Granger Causality Tests:

Strong evidence of bidirectional causality between Romanian and EU agricultural price indices, except for investment indices, which appear exogenous in the system.

This suggests that price adjustments in Romania are influenced by EU trends, but also impact EU markets, reinforcing the integration of the Romanian agricultural sector.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Correspondence Analysis (CA) ‚Äì Consumer Preferences

A structured survey was conducted to assess consumer interest in organic products and identify market trends.

Survey Data Used:

Number of respondents: 211.

Regions covered: Constan»õa, Ialomi»õa, and Bucharest.

Total number of questions: 29, including open-ended and closed-ended types.

Data collected:

Demographics: Gender, age, education level, residence, income, occupation.

Consumer behavior: Frequency of organic product purchases, willingness to pay a premium.

Perceptions: Views on organic food vs genetically modified (GMO) food, key purchase decision factors (freshness, packaging, origin, price/quality ratio, marketing influence).

Key Findings from Correspondence Analysis (CA):

CA between Age and Organic Consumption Frequency:

Young consumers (18-25) have a higher likelihood of consuming organic products weekly, while older consumers prefer monthly or occasional consumption.

Respondents over 40 tend to associate organic product consumption with health benefits rather than environmental impact.

CA between Occupation and Purchase Preference:

Professionals with stable incomes prioritize certification labels and product origin.

Students and part-time workers are more price-sensitive, favoring affordability over organic certification.

CA between Income and Willingness to Pay for Organic Products:

Higher-income individuals (>5000 RON) show stronger preference for organic goods and willingness to pay a premium.

Lower-income groups prefer discounted or locally sourced organic products.

CA between Household Size and Organic Spending:

Larger households prioritize bulk purchasing and cost efficiency.

Single-person households show higher per capita spending on organic food.

CA between Number of Children and Organic Product Awareness:

Families with children have higher awareness levels of organic food benefits.

Households without children show lower concern for organic certification labels.

CA between Education Level and Trust in Organic Certification:

University graduates express higher trust in European organic labels.

Respondents with lower education levels are more skeptical about the authenticity of organic branding.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion and Policy Recommendations

The findings highlight key areas for improvement in Romania's agricultural market, emphasizing the role of subsidies, market integration, and consumer behavior shifts toward organic products.

Recommendations:

Enhance Subsidy Programs:

Expanding financial support for organic farming can increase production and lower prices for consumers.

A tiered subsidy system based on farm size and sustainability practices should be considered.

Market Diversification:

Encouraging international trade agreements can help stabilize market fluctuations and increase demand.

Expanding partnerships with regional organic certification bodies could enhance consumer trust.

Consumer Awareness Campaigns:

Government and private sector initiatives should focus on educating consumers about the benefits and authenticity of organic food.

Clearer labeling and transparency in the supply chain could improve confidence in organic products.

Infrastructure Development:

Investments in local supply chains can reduce costs and improve product accessibility.

A focus on direct-to-consumer distribution models (such as farm cooperatives) can reduce intermediary costs.
